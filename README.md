## Approach taken

- i am a game master for the friend group im in and i have a hard time remembering all the npcs (non player characters) and thought it would be nice to have a web site to help with that. with this u will be able to log npc as well as go back and add stats to the ones that are relevant to the story. all at your finger tips and your table will never know. 

## Unsolved problems

- im working on getting user login and registration working its set up to function page wise but need to look into how to do this with djoser.

## Notes for latter

- have looked into authentO for a their party api for user log in and registration. also its got the code to toggle between login and register and to show the details for the npcs in the future.
